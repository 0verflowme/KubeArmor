## Development Guide

1. Bare-metal Environment
   * Requirements

     Here is the list of requirements for a bare-metal environment.

     ```text
     Kubernetes - v1.19 (or newer)
     Docker - 18.03 (or newer) / Containerd - 1.3.7 (or newer)
     Linux Kernel - v4.15 (or newer)
     LSM - AppArmor (+ SELinux and KRSI)
     ```

     First of all, KubeArmor is designed for Kubernetes, which means that Kubernetes should be ready in your environment. If Kubernetes is not prepared yet, please refer to [Kubernetes installation guide](k8s_installation_guide.md). KubeArmor also requires Docker or Containerd since it internally uses their APIs. If you have other container platforms \(e.g., Podman\), please make an issue in this repository. While we are going to adopt other container platforms in KubeArmor, we may be able to adjust the priorities of our planned tasks on demand. KubeArmor requires LSMs to operate properly; thus, please make sure that your environment supports LSMs \(at least, AppArmor\).

     Note that KubeArmor does not work on MiniKube because MiniKube does not support AppArmor. In addition, KubeArmor does not work if you use Docker Desktops on Windows and MacOS because such environments do not have a full Linux file system.

   * Environmetal Setup

     In order to install all dependencies, please run the following command.

     ```text
     $ cd contributions/bare-metal
     (bare-metal) $ ./setup.sh
     ```

     [setup.sh](https://github.com/accuknox/KubeArmor/tree/2da01a6c9b8bcee32577671aef0dba853b2deb7b/contributions/bare-metal/setup.sh) will automatically install BCC \(latest\), Go \(v1.15.2\), and Protobuf \(3.14.0\).

     Now, you are ready to develop any code for KubeArmor. Enjoy your journey with KubeArmor.

   * \(Optional\) MicroK8s Setup

     In order to install MicroK8s, please run the following command.

     ```text
     $ cd contributions/bare-metal/microk8s
     (microk8s) $ ./install_microk8s.sh
     ```
2. Vagrant Environment
   * Requirements

     Here is the list of requirements for a Vagrant environment

     ```text
     Vagrant - v2.2.9
     VirtualBox - v6.0
     ```

     If you do not have Vagrant and VirtualBox in your environment, you can easily install them by running the following command.

     ```text
     cd contributions/vagrant
     (vagrant) $ ./setup.sh
     ```

   * VM Setup using Vagrant

     Now, it is time to create a VM for development.

     ```text
     cd contributions/vagrant
     (vagrant) $ ./create.sh
     ```

     You can directly use the vagrant command to create a VM.

     ```text
     (vagrant) $ vagrant up
     ```

     In this case, please make sure that you have ssh keys in '~/.ssh'. If you do not have ssh keys yet, please run the following command before running the above command \(i.e., 'vagrant up'\).

     ```text
     (vagrant) $ ssh-keygen -> [Enter] -> [Enter] -> [Enter]
     ```

     If you want to remove the created VM, please run the following command.

     ```text
     cd contributions/vagrant
     (vagrant) $ ./remove.sh
     ```

     You are ready to develop the code for KubeArmor. Enjoy your journey with KubeArmor.

     ```text
     cd contributions/vagrant
     (vagrant) $ vagrant ssh
     ```

## Code Directories

Here, we briefly give you the overview of KubeArmor's directories.

* Source code for KubeArmor \(/KubeArmor\)

  ```text
  KubeArmor/
    core        - The main body (start point) of KubeArmor
    discovery   - Automated security policy discovery (under development)
    enforcer    - Runtime policy enforcer (enforcing security policies into LSMs)
    feeder      - gRPC-based feeder (sending audit/system logs to a log server)
    monitor     - eBPF-based container monitor (mapping process IDs to container IDs)
    BPF         - eBPF code for container monitor
    log         - Message logger (stdout) for KubeArmor
    common      - Libraries internally used
    types       - Type definitions

  ```

* Source code for KubeArmor's log client

  ```text
  LogClient/    - gRPC-based log server
  protobuf/     - Protocol buffer
  ```

* Source code for KubeArmor's custom resource defintion \(CRD\)
